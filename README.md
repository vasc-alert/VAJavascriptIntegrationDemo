# Vasc-Alert Javascript Integration Demo

This is a very basic javascript project demonstrating ways to link into the Vasc-Alert Online service.

This is an early iteration of this demo and includes one test case that uses a POST request to view a single patient detail report.
More examples will be added as features/links are requested.

This project depends on having Node.js (and npm) installed. npm will manage all the dependencies for you. You can get more information
and download Node.js at [the official Nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/ "Official Nodejs Website").

To get started with this project, type ```npm install``` in the root directory of the project.
